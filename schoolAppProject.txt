You are asked to design an App to keep track of studentsâ€™ TODOs and Classes

This is the description provided by the client:

The user will be able to create a TODO and assign a description, due date, and priority. Optionally, the user can assign a classroom and a class to the TODO if it is related to academic activities.

TODOs can be classified as: Personal, Academic, Work, or Leisure.

The three possible priorities are: Urgent, Intermediate, and Optional.

TODOs should be removed when the user indicates that it was completed.

Additionally, the app should include a tracker of the classes that the student is taking at a college or high school.

Each class has a class code, a professor, a start time, end time, and classroom assigned.
