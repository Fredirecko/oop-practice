Applications of OOP:
programming paradigm used to solve problems. Break down a problem into real world object.  Abstract representation of real world objects that are in the program (i.e. car, bank, patient in hospital). Common topic in interviews. Applications - data science, app development, game development. Used in android/iOS app development.

Advantages of OOP:
Resusability - ability to create instances of classes any number of times (reusing), Maintainability - if you make a change in one object it should not have a great affect on all the other objects thus maintaining order, Easier testing/debugging - ability to find bugs based on a coherent and logical framework, extensibility - , improved design, modularity

Popular languages that support OOP:
python, java, php, c++, c#, kotlin, ruby

Instance:
Instances are objects made from classes. classes act like blueprints. They define categories.  Instances are concrete objects taht are created from the blueprints (classes). If one instance is changed it will not affect the other instance attributes. __init__ is a reserved method and known as a class constructor. It's executed when an instance is created. It initilizes the instance attributes. 

self parameter:
assigns the instance attribute to the instance that is being created (its self). self is used by convention.

class attributes:
